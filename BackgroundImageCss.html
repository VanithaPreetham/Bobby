    <p style="color:rgb(9, 44, 243);"> Mother is the most influential person in the life of every individual. 
        She is a very hard-working person who holds the most honourable position next to the Almighty. 
        She plays a crucial role in the holistic development of her child and always caters to the basic needs of her family. </p>
    <h1 style="color:bisque ; background-color: #4ee69f;"> The beauty of a mother-child relationship is that her love and sacrifice knows no bounds. 
        She is like a guiding star, teacher and best friend who always stands rock solid beside her child and family in all circumstances. </h1>
    <h4 style="color:rgb(233, 16, 16);"> My mother manages each and everything in the house and always puts her best foot forward to take care of me and other members of my family. 
        Despite being a working woman, she cooks the most delicious dishes for the whole family regularly. She stays awake whenever Iâ€™m not keeping well and gives me company during my exams. </h4>
